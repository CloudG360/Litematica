Litematica 1.12.2: With Printer
==============
Litematica is a client-side Minecraft mod using LiteLoader.
It is more or less a re-creation of or a substitute for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica),
for players who don't want to have Forge installed.
For compiled builds (= downloads), see http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/litematica

Changes to this fork
====================

This fork takes the Schematic Printer implementation from Lunatrius's Schematica mod and tries to make it work with Litematica.
